## Architecture & Implementation Plan 


To begin, each cloud service in this system will be described in terms of its specific role, highlighting how it relates to concepts covered in prior coursework. The accompanying visual diagram provides a clear mapping of these services and their interactions. Below is a service mapping of the plan, which gives a clear visualization of the layer, which service cloud could be used, the solution, and which module we learned in class.
