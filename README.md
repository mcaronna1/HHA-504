# HHA-504 Final Project: Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

## TITLE: Optimizing Patient Experience Through Wait Time Prediction 

## Overview

This project focuses on designing a cloud-based healthcare solution to address the problem of long and unpredictable patient wait times in outpatient clinics. Using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the system was designed to collect patient check-in data, process it securely, and generate real-time predictions for how long patients will wait before seeing a provider. The solution integrates multiple GCP services into a serverless, event-driven architecture that prioritizes scalability, cost efficiency, and patient data privacy.

The final design demonstrates that real-time wait time prediction can be achieved using lightweight serverless tools rather than complex batch-processing systems. By combining Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, and BigQuery, the system delivers timely predictions to patients and clinic staff while enforcing strong security controls and early de-identification of patient data. The results show a practical, low-cost architecture that improves transparency for patients, supports clinic workflow decisions, and remains compliant with healthcare privacy requirements, while also highlighting areas for future improvement such as model accuracy, automation, and real-time enhancements.
