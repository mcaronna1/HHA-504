# HHA-504 Final Project: Cloud Integration Mini-Capstone

## TITLE: Optimizing Patient Experience Through Wait Time Prediction 

## Overview

This project focuses on designing a cloud-based healthcare solution to address the problem of long and unpredictable patient wait times in outpatient clinics. Using Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the system was designed to collect patient check-in data, process it securely, and generate real-time predictions for how long patients will wait before seeing a provider. The solution integrates multiple GCP services into a serverless, event-driven architecture that prioritizes scalability, cost efficiency, and patient data privacy.

The final design shows that it’s possible to predict patient wait times in real time using simple, on-demand cloud tools instead of large, complicated systems. By using several Google Cloud services together, the system can quickly share updated wait times with patients and clinic staff while keeping patient information secure and removing identifying details early in the process. The possible solution is affordable, easy to operate, and helps patients better understand their wait times, supports clinic staff in managing schedules, and meets healthcare privacy rules, while also leaving room for future improvements.
